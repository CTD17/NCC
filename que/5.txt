Tejas owns a godown.
His godown has 10000000 rooms and these rooms are numbered from 2 to 10000001.Every room has a light bulb and a switch board. 
Tejas is very much fond of digital programming, he tries to trick his friend Mihir by programming the switch boards in such a way that:

i) a bulb couldn't be lit from the switch board in the room where it is placed.
ii) Switch board located in room number R is used to lit all the bulbs which are located in room number 2R,3R,4R,....and so on.
 
Initially all the bulbs are in OFF state. 

Tejas asks his friend Mihir to go sequentially from Room number 2 to 10000001 and switch on all the bulbs that could be switched on.
Mihir then found out that  some of the rooms are still dark.
Find the number of dark rooms.
