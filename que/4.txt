A plane contains L distinct lines and C distinct circles, figure out a way to maximize the number of points of intersections.
Hence, print the maximum number of intersection points possible in the plane.

PS : As the points of intersections need to be finite, NO TWO LINES SHOULD COINCIDE AND NO TWO CIRCLES SHOULD COINCIDE. xD xD

INPUT :
	1.)T (Number of test Cases )
	2.)First line of each test case contains two space separated integers L and C

OUTPUT:
For each test case print the Maximum number of points of intersections of L lines and C circles on new line.

CONSTRAINTS

1<=T<=100
0<=L<=100
0<=C<=100

Subtask #1 20 M

	1<=T<=10
	0<=L<=10
	0<=C<=10
	
Subtask #2 20 M
	
	1<=T<=20
	0<=L<=20
	0<=C<=20
